# TSP Visualizer

Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? This is the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) that this projects tackles. In doing so, several greedy algorithms have been implemented and animated from scratch, showing how different approaches lead to apparently similar, but still wildly varying results. 

## Deployed App
You can play with the deployed app [here](https://razvanborsan.github.io/tsp-visualizer/). The red dots represent cities or provinces; the yellow dot is the current starting point (the origin city mentioned earlier). 

### Tech stack

I used React with Chakra UI for the interface and deck.gl for the map. The algorithms themselves are written in plain JavaScript.

### Run locally

If you want to play around with the project locally, cloning it + npm install + npm start should suffice.


## Why did you add a map of the Roman Empire?

Reading history is one of my hobbies and the history of Rome has never failed to pique my interest; I thought it a fun little thing to add the roman provinces next to the USA and all the continents, just to see if all roads do, indeed, lead to Rome.
